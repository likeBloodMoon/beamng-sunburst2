# beamng-sunburst2
A tuning-focused addon for the Sunburst2 2.5L F4 that turns it into a proper experimental monster. This pack adds a fully tunable Lua-powered ECU, multiple variable-geometry turbo options, and transmission choices built to handle stupid amounts of torque. A new 6.2L OHV V8 option keeps things spicy for longitudinal swaps.

🧠 Deluxe Lua ECU

Adjustable rev limiter & cut time

Custom idle RPM

Power Multiplier slider (0.2×–5×) that scales the whole torque curve

Toggleable “indestructible engine” mode

Fine-tune damage thresholds (cylinder walls, head gasket, piston rings, rods, torque limits)

🔥 6.2L Longitudinal V8

Tonawanda/St. Catharines-inspired 6.2L OHV with 420 hp @ 5600 rpm and 460 lb-ft @ 4100 rpm

Longitudinal layout for swaps plus ECU/transmission compatibility

🌀 Variable Geometry Turbo Kits (Stages 1–3)

Mild Stage 1, balanced Stage 2, or aggressive Stage 3 vane/boost defaults

Low/high boost multipliers with smooth transition RPM

Adjustable spool time for how “lazy” or “snappy” the turbo feels

Transient peak shaping and optional gauge/sound hooks

⚙️ Transmissions

15-Speed Manual Transmission & Transaxle: close lower gears for acceleration, long upper gears for top speed/cruise

6-Speed Sequential Transmission: quick-shifting sport option with taller cruise gears

8-Speed Automatic Transmission: wide spread with sport mode shift logic to keep big torque on boil

Beefed-up torque capacity to survive high power + crazy power multiplier setups


PS. yes I know I could have made all in jbeam, shush
